                    <span class="bluelight">
                        RO collects and uses personal data of users only as far as it is necessary to provide and
                        maintain a functional website and the content and services on the platform. In general, the
                        collection and use of the personal data of the users takes place only after consent of the user
                        has been obtained, or if the processing of the data is already permitted by legal
                        regulations.<br><br>

                        Insofar as RO obtains the consent of the users for the processing of their personal data, Art. 6
                        (1) (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis.<br><br>

                        In case the processing of personal data is required for the performance of a contract to which
                        the user is a party, Art 6 (1) (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to
                        processing operations in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering into a
                        contract.<br><br>

                        Insofar as processing personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation, which
                        RO is subject to, Art 6 (1) (c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.<br><br>

                        In the event, that the vital interests of the user or another natural person require the
                        processing of personal data, Art 6 (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.<br><br>

                        If processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of RO or a third party
                        and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not override the
                        former interest, then Art 6 (1) (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.<br><br>

                        The personal data of the user will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage
                        ceases to apply. In addition, data may be stored if it has been provided for by European or
                        national legislators in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which RO is subject. The
                        data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned
                        standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or
                        fulfilment of a contract.<br><br>

                    </div>
                    <span class="bluelight">
                        At each of our webpages, the webserver used by RO automatically collects data and information of
                        the accessing computer.<br><br>

                        The following data is collected:<br><br>

                        (1) information about the type of browser and the version used<br>
                        (2) operating system of the user<br>
                        (3) internet service provider of the user<br>
                        (4) IP address of the user<br>
                        (5) location, date and time of access<br><br>

                        This data is used for session handling and will also be saved in the log files on the server.
                        The IP address is transmitted with each server request so that the server knows where to send
                        the response. Every internet user is assigned an IP address by his Internet Service Provider
                        (ISP) as soon as he connects to the Internet. The ISP can trace which IP address was assigned to
                        which of its customers at which time. As long as the IP address is stored, the identity of the
                        subscriber can theoretically be determined by the ISP. RO saves the complete IP Address only
                        temporarily to log files for debugging purposes and threat protection. The complete IP address
                        is deleted after three days, so that the recorded data is then anonymous and identification of
                        the user is no longer possible.<br><br>

                        The processing of this data serves to deliver the contents of the website, to guarantee the
                        functionality of the information technology systems and to optimize the website. The data of the
                        log files are stored separately from other personal data.<br><br>

                        The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art 6 (1) (f) GDPR.<br><br>

                        The temporary storage of the IP address by the server is necessary to enable the website to be
                        delivered to the user’s computer. For this the IP address of the user must remain stored for the
                        duration of the session.<br><br>

                        The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, RO
                        uses the data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of the IT systems.<br><br>

                        RO’s legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Art 6 (1) (f) GDPR lies in these
                        purposes.<br><br>

                        The data will be deleted as soon it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they
                        were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is
                        the case when the respective session has ended.<br><br>

                        If the data is stored in log files, deletion occurs after seven days at the latest. Further
                        storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so
                        that assignment of the accessing client is no longer possible.<br><br>

                        The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is
                        essential for the secure and data protection compliant operation of the website. There is
                        consequently no opportunity to object on the part of the user.<br><br>

                        cookie contains a characteristic character string that enables a unique identification of the
                        browser when the website is accessed again.<br><br>

                        Some elements of the website require that the accessing browser can be identified even after a
                        page change.<br><br>

                        The following data is stored and transmitted within the cookies:<br><br>

                        The user data collected in this way is pseudonymized by technical precautions. Therefore, it is
                        no longer possible to assign the data to an accessing user. The data will not be stored together
                        with other personal data of the users.<br><br>

                        Upon accessing the website, the user will be informed about the use of cookies for analytical
                        purposes. In this context, reference is also made to this data protection declaration.<br><br>

                        The Legal basis for processing personal data using technically necessary cookies is Art 6 (1)
                        (f) GDPR.<br><br>

                        The legal basis for processing personal data using cookies for analytical purposes, if the user
                        has given his or her consent in this regard, is Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR, otherwise Art 6 (1) (a)
                        GDPR.<br><br>

                        The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to facilitate the use of websites for
                        users. Some functions of the website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For this it
                        is necessary that the browser is recognized even after a page change.<br><br>

                        The user data collected by technically necessary cookies are not used to create user
                        profiles.<br><br>

                        The user also has full control over the use of cookies. Through a change of the settings in the
                        internet browser users can deactivate or limit the transmission of cookies. Already stored
                        cookies can at any time be deleted. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are
                        deactivated for the website, it may however no longer be possible to fully use all functions of

                        In this context, there is no disclosure of the data to third parties. The data are used
                        exclusively for processing the conversation.<br><br>

                        The legal basis for the processing of the data in the event of the user’s consent is Art 6 (1)
                        (a) GDPR.<br><br>

                        The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an email is Art
                        6 (1) (f) GDPR. If the email contact is aimed at the conclusion of a contract, then additional
                        legal basis for the processing is Art 6 (1) (b) GDPR.<br><br>

                        The processing of the personal data of contact by email serves RO alone for the treatment of the
                        establishment of contact. In the event of contact by email, this also constitutes the necessary
                        legitimate interest in the processing of the data.<br><br>

                        The other personal data processed during the sending process serves to prevent misuse and to
                        ensure the security of the information technology systems.<br><br>

                        The data will be deleted as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was
                        collected. For the personal data transmitted via email this is the case once the conversation
                        with the user has ended. The conversation is terminated when it can be inferred from the
                        circumstances that the facts in question have been finally clarified.<br><br>

                        The user always has the possibility to rescind his consent regarding the processing of his
                        personal data. If the user contacts RO by email, he can object to the storage of his personal
                        data at any time. In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued.<br><br>

                        (8) The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling in accordance with article
                        22(1) and (4) GDPR and – at least in these cases – meaningful information on the logic involved
                        and the scope and intended effects of such processing for the user.<br>

                        Users have the right to request information as to whether personal data relating to the user is
                        transferred to a third country or to an international organization. In this context, users may
                        request to be informed of the appropriate guarantees in accordance with art 46 GDPR in
                        connection with the transmission.<br><br>

                        2. Right to rectification<br><br>

                        Users have the right to rectification and/or completion vis –a- vis RO if the processed personal
                        data concerning the user is incorrect or incomplete. RO must make the correction without
                        delay.<br><br>

                        3. Right to restriction of processing<br><br>

                        Users may request the restriction of the processing of personal data concerning the user under
                        the following conditions:<br><br>

                        (1) If the user contests the accuracy of the personal data the period of restriction can be
                        extended allowing for RO to verify the accuracy of the personal data;<br>
                        (2) The processing is unlawful and the user opposes the deletion of the personal data and
                        requests the restriction of their use instead;<br>
                        (3) RO no longer requires the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are
                        required by the user for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or<br>
                        (4) If the user has objected to processing pursuant to article 21(1) pending the verification
                        whether the legitimate grounds of RO override those of the user.<br>

                        Where processing has been restricted, such data shall, with the exception of storage, only be
                        processed with the user’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims
                        or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
                        important public interest of the European Union or of a Member State.<br>

                        If the processing of data has been restricted according to the above conditions, users will be
                        informed by RO before the restriction is lifted.<br>

                        4. Right to delete<br><br>

                        a) Deletion obligation<br><br>

                        Users have the right to obtain from RO the deletion of his personal data without undue delay and
                        RO is obligated to delete this personal data without undue delay where one of the following
                        grounds applies:<br><br>

                        (1) The personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was
                        collected or otherwise processed.<br>
                        (2) The user withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to Art 6 (1) (a) or
                        Art 9 (2) (a) GDPR and where there is no legal ground for the processing.<br>
                        (3) User objects to the processing pursuant to Art 21 (1) GDPR and there are no overriding
                        legitimate grounds for the processing, or the user objects to the processing pursuant to Art
                        21(2) GDPR.<br><br>
                        (4) The personal data has been unlawfully processed.<br>
                        (5) The personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member
                        State law to which RO is subject.<br>
                        (6) The personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of information society
                        services referred to in art 8(1) GDPR.<br>

                        b) Passing information to third parties<br><br>

                        If RO has made public the personal data relating to the User and if RO is obliged to delete such
                        data pursuant to Art 17(1) GDPR, RO shall take appropriate measures, including technical
                        measures, considering the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform those
                        responsible for data processing who process the personal data, that user as data subject has
                        requested RO to delete all links to such personal data or copies or replications of such
                        personal data.<br><br>

                        c) Exceptions<br><br>

                        The right to deletion does not exist insofar as the processing is necessary<br><br>

                        (1) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;<br>
                        (2) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by the European Union or
                        Member State law to which RO is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the
                        public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in RO;<br>
                        (3) For the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.<br>

                        If users have exercised the right to correct, delete or limit the processing vis-à-vis RO, RO is
                        obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data relating to the user has been
                        disclosed of this correction or deletion of the data or restriction of processing, unless this
                        proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.<br>

                        Users have the right vis-à-vis RO to be informed about these recipients.

                        5. Right to data transferability

                        Users have the right to receive user-related personal data provided to users in a structured,
                        common, and machine-readable format. In addition, users have the right to transfer this data to
                        another person without hindrance by RO, provided that

                        (1) Processing is based on consent pursuant to art 6(1) (a) GDPR or art 9 (2) (a) GDPR or on a
                        contract pursuant to Art 6 (1) (b) GDPR and<br>
                        (2) The processing is done by automated means.<br><br>

                        In the exercise of this right, users also have the right to request that the personal data
                        relating to the user is transmitted directly by a responsible person to another responsible
                        person, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons must
                        not be affected by this.<br><br>

                        6. Right of objection<br><br>

                        The users have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at
                        any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on art 6 (1) (e) or
                        (f) including profiling based on those positions.<br><br>

                        RO shall no longer process the personal data unless RO demonstrates compelling legitimate
                        grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the user or for
                        the establishment, exercise of defense of legal claims.<br><br>

                        Where the user’s personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, the user has the
                        right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such
                        marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
                        marketing.<br><br>

                        Where the user objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no
                        longer be processed for such purposes.<br><br>

                        Users have the possibility in connection with the use of information society’s services- not
                        withstanding Directive 2002/58/EC to exercise their right of objection by means of automated
                        procedures using technical specifications.<br><br>

                        7. Right to revoke consent with data protection relevance<br><br>

                        Users have the right to revoke their data protection relevant consent at any time. The
                        revocation of consent does not affect the legality of processing carried out based on the
                        consent until revocation.<br><br>

                        8. Automated individual decision-making, including profiling<br><br>

                        The user has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing,
                        including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly
                        significantly affects him or her. This not applicable if the decision<br><br>

                        (1) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the user and RO,<br>
                        (2) is authorized by European Union or Member State law to which RO is subject and which also
                        lays down suitable measures to safeguard the User’s rights and freedoms and legitimate
                        interests;<br>
                        (3) is based on the user’s explicit consent.<br>

                        However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art
                        9 (1) GDPR, unless art 9 (2) (a) or (g) GDPR applies and appropriate measures have been taken to
                        protect the user’s right and freedoms and the user’s legitimate interests.<br><br>

                        9. Right to raise a complain to a supervisory authority<br><br>

                        Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy users have the right to raise a
                        complaint at a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of residence, place of
                        work, or place of suspected infringement, if users consider that the processing of personal data
                        relating to the user is in violation of the GDPR.<br><br>

                        The supervisory authority at which the complaint has been raised shall inform the complainant of
                        the status and results of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under
                        art 78 GDPR.<br><br>

                        RO reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy any time at its sole discretion.
